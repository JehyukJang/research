# Kate Polynomial Commitment implementation in MATLAB

- There are two main scripts;  "Kate_commit_protocol.m" and "Kate_commit_batch_protocol.m".
- "Kate_commit_protocol.m": An instantation of polynomial commitment protocol supporting single polynomial with single evaluation.
- "Kate_commit_batch_protocol.m": An instantation of polynomial commitment protocol supporting single polynomial with multiple evaluations.
